## Calendar LED screen

This is an improved version of the [Hardware google calendar + clock](https://github.com/nikuz/clock-calendar).

It serves the same purpose - to display calendar events, but features much higher pixel density, which turns it into a 1024 x 128 screen that can display any adjusted to size web applications.
